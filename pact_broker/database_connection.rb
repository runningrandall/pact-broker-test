##
# Sequel by default does not test connections in its connection pool before
# handing them to a client. To enable connection testing you need to load the
# "connection_validator" extension like below. The connection validator
# extension is configurable, by default it only checks connections once per
# hour:
#
# http://sequel.rubyforge.org/rdoc-plugins/files/lib/sequel/extensions/connection_validator_rb.html
#
#
# A gotcha here is that it is not enough to enable the "connection_validator"
# extension, we also need to specify that we want to use the threaded connection
# pool, as noted in the documentation for the extension.
#
# -1 means that connections will be validated every time, which avoids errors
# when databases are restarted and connections are killed.  This has a performance
# penalty, so consider increasing this timeout if building a frequently accessed service.
